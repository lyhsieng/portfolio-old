        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          As part of an Interaction Design course at UC San Diego, I worked in a
          team of three to research, design, and develop a mobile web app.
          Through this 10 weeks, we learned design principles and techniques and
          the web development process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our app, called Short Wayze,
          <b
            >aims at helping new students and visitors get across UCSD campus
            faster while avoiding constructions and cops, and giving users a
            better understanding of the campus.</b
          >
          I was primarily responsible for designing and developing the user
          interface, user testing, and setting up weekly meetings. I also
          contributed to user research and app deployment.

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="problem-statement">
          "I'm often late to class because I'm new to campus and don't know my
          way around. I tried to use Google Maps but it doesn't provide
          shortcuts or show UCSD building plans. "
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          UC San Diego has a large campus and new students and visitors coming
          to UC San Diego may not be knowledgeable of the layout of the campus.
          Therefore, they often waste their precious time taking long routes or
          looking for a classroom in a new building.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section user-research">
        <h2>Need-finding and Research</h2>
        <p>
          The first step of our design process was to observe people to
          understand our target audience and identify breakdowns. We started by
          conducting interviews and asking open-ended questions, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you like about UCSD? What don’t you like about UCSD?</li>
          <li>
            When was the last time that you were lost on campus? What happened?
          </li>
          <li>How do you get to class?</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          From these interviews, we were able to get better insights on the
          problems that our target users were facing. These were the common
          problems among the first-year, second-year, transfer students, and
          visitors:
        </p>
        <ol class="needFinding">
          <li>Difficulty finding buildings and classrooms</li>
          <li>Not knowing the shortcuts around campus</li>
          <li>Running into cops while skateboarding and biking</li>
          <li>Had problems finding detours when there were constructions.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          After figuring out our target audience and user needs, we started an
          inspiration board by taking three apps that relate to our design idea
          and pulling inspirations from these three apps. For example, we liked
          the <b>step-by-step and directions functionality by Google Maps </b>,
          the <b> reporting features in Waze </b>, and the
          <b>ability to view and import floor plans in Magicplan. </b>

        <div class="section storyboarding">
          <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
          <p>
            To begin the design process, we created storyboards that could
            potentially be the solutions to our problem statement. It was
            important for us to focus on problems and situations rather than
            features and functionalities. By doing these storyboards, we were
            able to get an idea of how users will interact with our design and
            app.

          <h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>
          <p>
            Our next step in the design process was to take our storyboards and
            create paper prototypes .
            <b
              >These prototypes were low-level because we wanted to focus on the
              important UI elements rather than the visual appearance of the
              application </b
            >. However, it was hard for us not to focus on the small details
            because it was our first time making paper prototypes. Looking back,
            we were proud of ourselves that we did not waste a lot of time
            focusing on the appearance of the app.

        <p>
          After creating our two paper prototypes, we
          <b
            >conducted heuristic evaluations on three users, following Jacob
            Nielson’s 10 general principles for interaction design </b
          >. Below are our findings from the evaluations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Prototype A: </span> There were a few common
            issues that three of our users encountered when testing prototype A.
            First, when they first arrived at the homepage, they weren’t sure
            what to do next due to lack of instructions on the page for first
            time users. Second, after selecting the starting and ending
            location, they were confused as to why a static image of the map
            showed up the path drawn out. Users reported that it would be
            helpful to see the route more clearly. Lastly, users were stuck
            trying to figure out how to delete a report that has been there for
            a long time and said that they would like the ability to delete or
            hide old reports.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Prototype B: </span>While observing users
            testing our paper prototype B, we noticed a few problems that users
            were having trouble with. Most testers did not like clicking two
            different tabs to see the cops report and construction report. They
            said they would rather have both of these reports on one page. Many
            also thought that their report was not added when in actuality it
            was. So they suggested that a pop up message saying their report was
            added would be helpful.

      <div class="section wireframe">
        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
        <p>
          After testing our paper prototypes and going over the feedback that
          our testers gave us, we would then combine the feedback and
          suggestions from both prototypes to create our first wireframes.

      <div class="section user-testing">
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          After we finished creating our wireframes, we began to code those
          wireframes into a semi-functional application that could be tested.
          Before testing, we created tasks that we wanted our testers to do:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            find a shortcut from Geisel Library to 64 Degrees
          </li>
          <li>find the CSE floor 1 building plan</li>
          <li>Upload a new UCSD building plan</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We created these tasks because we were particularly
          <b
            >interested in how our users interact with the shortcut
            functionality as well as how they respond to the layout of the
            building plans.
          </b>
          We asked the user to think out loud as they complete the task because
          the goal of this test is to identify any problems users may have in
          understanding or finding a shortcut and a building plan using our app.
          Below are our findings from the test:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Users tried to click on icons on static map but nothing happened
          </li>
          <li>
            Users were not sure where to route was telling them to go because
            the map was to small
          </li>
          <li>
            Users were confused whether their building plan was succesfully
            added
          </li>
          <li>First time visitors were unsure where to start</li>

            <span class="emphasis">User: </span> User thought that the cop and
            construction markers/icons on the map were clickable. He tried to
            click on every icon and realized that nothing happened. The markers
            were misleading because map markers/icons are usually clickable.
            However, he was able to identify what the icons were just by looking
            at them.

        <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to the heuristic evaluations we conducted, we also wanted
          to collect data on two variations of our building plan page. So we
          <b> created an A/B testing through Google Analytics. </b> We wanted to
          get data on how long users spend on each page and how often they use
          the search functionality.

          We think this was due to the fact that Version B has a cleaner and
          more friendly UI. Therefore, we decided to keep this version as our
          final design.

          <span class="emphasis">Homepage: </span> Originally we wanted the
          homepage to have a live map with cops and construction markers on it.
          We had assumed that users would understand that it is a static map and
          they would not be able to interact with it. However, through user
          testing we found out that our assumption was wrong. First time users
          thought it was an interactive map and tried to click on the icons only
          to find out, they don’t do anything. Furthermore, for first time
          visitors visiting UCSD, they did not know the landmarks and routes so
          they were struggling with how to use the app itself. So we took these
          feedbacks and redesigned our homepage UI. In our new homepage, we got
          rid of the map and replaced it with six famous landmarks at UCSD. Each
          location card contains a short background, the location, and hours.
          This will provide new visitors to campus an idea of places to visit at
          UCSD.

        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"> Route and Direction: </span> When we first
          started brainstorming design ideas for the shortcut feature, we wanted
          to do something similar to Google Maps and Waze, which would require
          using Google API for a live map. However, since we had never used
          Google API before and we were also under a time crunch, we had trouble
          implementing the live map. So we decided to just use a static map with
          the shortcuts drawn out manually. After reviewing the feedback from
          our user testings, we noticed common problems that our users faced
          with the static map. First, they had trouble understanding the route
          because the map was so zoomed out. Secondly, new visitors to campus
          had no idea where to start or turn because of their lack of
          understanding of the layout of the campus. So, I decided to redesign
          and implement the functionality of the shortcut feature. Since our app
          targets new users coming to UCSD, I replaced the static map, with step
          by step directions, using landmarks as guiding points. Users can click
          on the direction and see the picture of the landmark and some facts
          about that landmark.

          <br />
          <span class="emphasis">Report: </span> The original design of the
          report page was too clustered and was overwhelming to users. I decided
          to change the page title to a smaller font size because the font size
          was too big. Also, I added an information icon to replace the long
          texts that made the page look clustered. The icon makes the UI look
          more user friendly while still achieving the same purpose as the
          original design; informing users what the page is about.

          looking at the user testing feedback, our assumption was wrong. Users
          were not sure about what they could do on the page. So we tooks those
          feedback and added some texts to inform users what the page is about.
          However, the texts made the page look clustered. So we decided to fix
          the page styling by adding an icon that displays a pop up information
          if users clicked on it. This makes the page look cleaner. Also we also
          group the buttons horizontal because it’s easier to read for left to
          right then top to bottom.

          and going from development to production level. I learnt how to divide
          these tasks to be efficient in development, and how to merge different
          ideas into one final product. I also became familiar with the process
          of incorporating user feedback into our app and the importance of
          having third parties critique our work outside of our group. Some good
          planning choices we made as a team were having weekly meetings about
          the status of our work, and assigning each member to a task to speed
          up the development. Some less successful planning decisions were that
          we tended to end up doing most of the weekly work a few days before
          the deadline so oftentimes we were crunched for time towards the end.
          If I were to do it again, I would focus more on starting earlier so
          that my team could feel less pressure throughout the week, and maybe
          set more realistic goals for what we want our app to do while taking
          into consideration our skill level with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
